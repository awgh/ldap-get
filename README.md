# ldap-get

Utility to safely fetch Java class files being served by LDAP servers, like maybe you've been seeing in your logs.  

Includes deobfuscator for common Log4J URL obfuscation techniques.  

This utility is in Go, so it can't accidentally your remote Java class.  

However be careful not to run it later.  

Maybe never install Java on *anything ever*.
